**Traffic Routing Advisor (Fuzzy Logic Based)**

This project implements a Traffic Routing Advisor designed to make smarter routing decisions under uncertain and conflicting traffic conditions.
Instead of relying on rigid binary rules, the system uses Fuzzy Logic combined with a Delta-based voting mechanism. This allows it to handle edge cases gracefully, resolve conflicting inputs without failure, and adapt its decisions dynamically based on the time of day.
The architecture is built to be resilient and flexible, making it suitable for real-world traffic scenarios where data is often incomplete or inconsistent. To ensure correctness and stability, comprehensive internal unit tests are included, all of which pass with 100% accuracy, confirming the reliability of the decision-making logic.

**Key Features**

1. Fuzzy logic–based decision making

2. Delta-based voting system to resolve conflicts

3. Adaptive behavior based on time-dependent conditions

4. Robust handling of edge cases and inconsistent data

5. Fully tested with 100% unit test success rate
